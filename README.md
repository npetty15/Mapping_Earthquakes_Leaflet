## Purpose of Analysis

I was asked to pull together several GeoJSON attributes onto a Leaflet map that would track earthquakes over the last 7 days. Every time this map is viewed new data should be present as I am using live data pulled from several websites. What is represented on this map are three types of overlays: street, satalitte, and light. There are also three filters that can be added or removed from the maps: tectonic plates, earthquakes, and major earthquakes. 

With all of these elements available, it makes for dynamic map that can be adjusted to the user's needs.
